## The Four Levels of Measurement
In order to choose an appropriate plot type or method of analysis for your data, you need to understand the types of data you have. One common method divides the data into four levels of measurement:

###Qualitative or categorical types (non-numeric types)
1. Nominal data: pure labels without inherent order
2. Ordinal data: labels with an intrinsic order or ranking (comparison operations can be made between values)

###Quantitative or numeric types
3. Interval data: numeric values where absolute differences are meaningful (addition and subtraction operations can be made)
4. Ratio data: numeric values where relative differences are meaningful (multiplication and division operations can be made)
All quantitative-type variables also come in one of two varieties: discrete and continuous.

Discrete quantitative variables can only take on a specific set values at some maximum level of precision.
Continuous quantitative variables can (hypothetically) take on values to any level of precision.
When exploring your data, the most important thing to consider first is whether your data is qualitative or quantitative. In later lessons, you will see how this distinction impacts your choice of plots.
